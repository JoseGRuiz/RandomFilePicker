# RandomFilePicker
a test of filesystem and random from newer c++ standards 

how to use:
Simply place the executable in the lowest folder you want to randomly select from and open the executable. 
Will randomly select and open any regular file within that folder as well as any subfolders recursively. 
Note that this means that it can open any file on a drive if placed at the lowest level. Therefore it is advisable
to create a seperate directory with any of the files you want to randomly select. 

Great for when you can't decide which movie to view or song to play.
